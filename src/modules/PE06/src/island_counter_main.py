"""island_counter_main.py

This script demonstrates the usage of the IslandCounterClass to count the number of islands
in a grid representation of a map.

Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands.
An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or
vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
