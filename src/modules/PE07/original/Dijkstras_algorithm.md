Dijkstra's algorithm, developed by Dutch computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra, is a significant method used to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks, internet routing, or social networks.

The algorithm begins at a selected start node (often called the "source node") and analyzes all immediate neighbors. It calculates the tentative distances from the source to all these nodes, keeping track of the smallest value. This minimal value represents the shortest path from the start node to a neighboring one.

Once all immediate neighbors have been assessed, the algorithm moves to the node with the smallest recorded distance, marks it as "visited" (meaning we've established the shortest path to it), and then reassesses all the non-visited neighbors of this node, recalculating their tentative distances.

The process repeats, continually moving to the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance, until it has visited every node. At the end, the algorithm will have determined the shortest path from the original start node to every other node.

An important note is that Dijkstra's algorithm assumes all edge weights in the graph are non-negative. If there are negative edges, the algorithm can't reliably find the shortest path.

Dijkstra's algorithm finds applications in network routing protocols, artificial intelligence for path-finding, civil engineering for urban traffic networks, and in telecommunications for establishing least-cost paths in networking routing tables. It's a key tool in computational mathematics and computer science, underpinning many of the services and systems we use today.
